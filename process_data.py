# Define a refined custom prompt to explicitly distinguish runway issues

You are analyzing aviation accident topics. Each topic is described by:
- A set of KEYWORDS: [KEYWORDS]
- A few SAMPLE DOCUMENTS: [DOCUMENTS]

Your goal:
1. Carefully read the keywords and sample documents.
2. Identify all significant factors mentioned, such as mechanical issues, runway conditions, environmental factors, pilot actions, fuel management, and visual/lighting conditions.
3. Provide a SINGLE, concise label that reflects the dominant contributing factor(s).

Important:
- If the reports mention runway misalignment, inadequate runway lighting, or a lack of visual cues (e.g., darkness, insufficient runway lights), label the topic to reflect those issues, for example, "Runway Error" or "Poor Runway Lighting".
- Only label as "Fuel Management" if the main issue is related to fuel exhaustion, refueling errors, or inadequate fuel planning.
- Do NOT include "engine power" if the primary issue is about runway or lighting factors.
- Keep the label short (2-3 words) with no extra explanation.
- Do not repeat the same keywords or sample documents in your label.

Output format:
topic: <label>
